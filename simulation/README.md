1. simulation_settings.R: All the experiments and their parameter settings
2. SparseDOSSA_setting.R: Utility function that generates parameters for sparsedossa function
3. methods_evaluation/: utility function for evaluating performances of competing DAA methods
4. FoldChange/: contains codes and results for experiments with taxa abundance fold changes
5. propDA/: contains codes and results for experiments with proportion of DA taxa
6. SeqDepth/ : contains codes and results for experiments with different library sizes/sequencing depths
7. TaxaNum/: contains codes and results for experiments with different total taxa number
8. SampleSize/: contains codes and results for experiments with different sample sizes.
9. confounder/: contains codes and results where some taxa abundance are correlated with the confounder
10. Null_Case/: cases when there are no DA taxa. The sequencing depths may differ significantly between two groups.
